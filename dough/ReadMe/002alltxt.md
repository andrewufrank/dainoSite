The source of the web site should be stored in open file formats, which can be exchanged and read by many programs. It should be easy to take a site organized with one SSG and put it into another one. Proprietary formats make it typically hard to extract content and store it in an open format to move it to another program, locking users in. 

The principle speaks against use of databases to store content (so called Content Management Systems) which are probably justified for large, very high traffic sites.
