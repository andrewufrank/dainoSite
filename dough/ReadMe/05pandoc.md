## Source files are converted to HTML using Pandoc

The web page sources are translated using Pandoc to HTML and a pdf. 

Pandoc is equally used to convert the markdown sources to latex and then to a PDF. 

Pandoc would allow three dozens of [input formats](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html). At the moment, page sources must be written in the Pandoc markdown language, but essentially any other input Pandoc can read could be used (e.g. `latex`).

## `Shake` controls the conversion

Shake is a improve `make` producing a desired set of files from sources and rules. It is driven by the correspondence between the `md` files which must be converted to `html` and draws in additional files as necessary.
