A number of issues are currently open. Here a list 

1. enumerations in abstracts (perhaps solved with `|`)
2. linebreaks in titles (problems with latex)
3. table of content in tufte in a single column (does not respect the fullwidth environment after a page break)
4. blog in `dainoSite` does not include text pages 
5. titles and sidenote column does not interact perfectly
6. formatted lists include too much white space
